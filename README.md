# projectileMotionGithub
Hello everyone. The purpose of this project is to be able to allow students studying a level physics to have a better understanding of projectile motion.
This project uses pygame for the rendering, matplolib for drawing live graphs and tkinter for the GUI.
To run this simulation, I suggest creating a folder on your machine, downloading all the contents on this main branch to that folder.
I have also added a virtual environment, This contains all the external packages that you need to run this simulation that are not part of the standard python library so luckily you do not have to worry about installing them.

To start with this simulation, Start off with running the file called "officialSimulation.py" file. Once you do, a window will pop up. One of the buttons, once u click it will open the instruction manual that will teach you how to use the projectile simulation.
